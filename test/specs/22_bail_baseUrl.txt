Importance of Bail & BaseUrl optionsi nthe config file

in config file:

'bail' option

say you have 40 test cases & first 12 failed.
looks like there's somethign up w. your app
could be anything (deployment issue, etc.
as there's this many failures already, no point waiting until all tests are complete

how to stop execution in this case:
	use the bail parameter
if you set it to 3, when 3 failures are encountered in the test run, the test will stop.

So if you have 20 tests, & you set bail = 3, test execution will stop after if you hit 3 failures.

Me: I set it to 3, & there were actually 4 failures. Not sure why it didn't stop for me after 3



--- BaseUrl --- 

Assume this is Prod URL
but you want to run your tests in lower level env's
so depending on which env you're testing, the url will be different
if you hardcode the url in each test, you'll need to update this everywhere each time you run in another env.
instead, you can set this in your config file:

Required Changes:
1. In `wdio.conf.js`, update the 'baseUrl' value with your URL:
		`baseUrl: "https://rahulshettyacademy.com",`
2. Update your tests where you're navigating to the page like so:
		`await browser.url("/loginpagePractise/");`
		This will pick up the baseUrl from the config file & append the above onto it before navigating.
