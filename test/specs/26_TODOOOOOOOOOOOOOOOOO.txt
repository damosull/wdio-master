How to apply Retry Mechanism for Flaky Tests with WDIO Conf

Flaky test = inconsistent results

For these kinds of tests, we can add retries if there's a high chance the test will pass the next time.

Google 'retry wdio'. In the docs serach for 'Rerun suites in Mocha'

The only code you need to add is:
`this.retries(4) // retry up to 4 times

Global level: Inside the describe(),

At the it() level: retry this test up to 4 times

MY QUESTION: If you specify retries at the describe() level, will it re-run ALL test cases, even those that passed?

Note: If you want to use retries, you need to use an unfound function [function(){}] instead of fat arrow [() => {}]. The reasoning is in the Mocha docs, but won't go into it here, we just need to know that you need to do it.

Look in the logs to see that it's being run multiple times
If the test failed for all retries, you should see Expected vs Received values for the number of times you re-ran the test.
If the test passed the 2nd time, you should only see that it ran twice
