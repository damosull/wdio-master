todo: NEED TO TIDY UP THESE NOTES & MAYBE DO AN EXAMPLE TO VALIDATE IT WORKS:




Package.json Scripts

You can define a script to run a command

Why do we need this?

Scenario 1:You want to run a particular test suite, so you run `npx wdio run wdio.conf.js -- suite creditCard` in the command line
Scenario 2: You want to specify a different configuration file, so you run `npx wdio run wdio.uat.conf.js`

It's difficult to remember all these parameters, so we can store all these commands/parameters in scripts, which we can then call

Examples:
Package.json:
"scripts": {
	"creditCardTests": "npx wdio run wdio.conf.js -- suite creditCard",
	"uat": "npx wdio run wdio.uat.conf.js",
}


Run commands:
`npm run creditCardTests`
`npm run uat`
