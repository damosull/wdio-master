CONTROLLING TEST EXECUTION VIA COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS

You can create test suites in the framework & control execution from command line parameters

Say you only want to run 2 files.

We've shown how you can use Grep by specifying keywords, but what if you want to do this for multiple spec files?
You don't want to enter 'Smoke' in every test case

In the case where you want an entire spec file (i think this is a describe() block) to run, 
another way of doing it is by using the `suites` parameter in the wdio.conf.js file

Wdio.conf.js:
suites: {
	debitCard: ['test/specs/uiControls.js', 'test/specs/windowsFrames.js'],
	creditCard: ['test/specs/eCommerceE2E.js']
}


Run Command (see package.json):
- Full command: npx wdio run wdio.conf.js --suite debitCard
- You can add it to your package.json scripts also:
    "scripts": {
      "suite": "wdio run ./wdio.conf.js --suite creditCard"
    },
